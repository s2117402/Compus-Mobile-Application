## Introduction
This is the graduation project for my bachlor degree.I finishe it in August 2015,and I didn't have a github account at that time,I find it today in my old laptop and decide to upload.Basically this is my first project with Android,I start from this.Concetely,this is a complex of many functionalirs.You can see the map here,you can log in and check your grade here(I can't check my grades due to the cancellation of my compus account),you can receive announcements form the administrator...

Now,I will introduct this app and all of its functionalits by each window in order.

###  About Marquee Bar
---
when this app was launced,our app will check the NJUPT(Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications) website and downloads three latest news and show it on the Marquee barï¼Œit will show the motto of NJUPY as well.

## Login Activity
---
This is the hardest part I faced on this entire project.In This part,I have to mocking logging in the grade system and get the grades back and dis play them,I need to use much html knowledge.At first of all,I download the Security code picture and display it on the activity,after user enter user name,password and Security code,I will use this information to mock loging in the system.Since I didn't know and I can't anything useful about how the grade system work,I have to test it again and again myself,I still remeber how much time it costed me to finish this part.After achiveing this function,user and check his grades in this app directly.

## Weather/Announcement/News Activity
